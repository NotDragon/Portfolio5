            <p>
                Fossil fuels are the current most commonly used energy source. They are used in almost every country in
                the world.
                They are also one of the most major constructors of cliamte change.

                <h3>How are fosil fuels formed?</h3>
            </u>
            <p>
                Fossil fuels were formed by the fosils of dead animals and plants exposed to:
            <ol>
                - High temperatures<br>
                - High pressures<br>
            </ol>
            Fosil fuels need millions of years to form and are non-renewable, meaning they can not be created in a human
            lifespan.

                <h3>What are the conditions that fosil fuels are formed?</h3>
            </u>
            <p>
                As you may know, fosil fuels are 3 different fuels, coal, natural gas and petroleum. They are all formed
                by fosils exposed in different conditions.
            <ol>
                - Coal: Coal is formed by the fosils of dead plants exposed to high temperatures and high pressures.<br>
                - Natural Gas: Natural gas is formed by the fosils of dead plants, algae, and plankton drifted in oceans
                and shallow seas exposed to high temperatures and low pressures.<br>
                - Petroleum: Petroleum is formed by the fosils of dead microorganisms exposed to low temperatures and
                high pressures. <br>
            </ol>
            </p><br>

                <h3>Why do some areas have more fosil fuesl then others?</h3>
            </u>
            <p>
                Millions of years ago the Earth had one supercontent called Pangea. Due to tectonic plates, it was spilt
                up to the 7 continents we know today. So areas like the middle east where
                and places that fosil fuels could form.
