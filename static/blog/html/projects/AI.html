                AI, Artifitian Inteligence, are algorithems that make robots and programs able to think. Over the past
                few years humans have been debating wether AI is good or not and if it wilkl ever become a thread

                <h3>Types of AI</h3>
            </u>
            <p>
                AI is generaly split to 3 categories
            <ul>
                - Narrow Inteligence<br>
                - General Inteligence<br>
                - Super Inteligence<br>
            </ul>
            Narrow Inteligence is AI programmed to do a specific task. General Inteligence is AI programed to be able to
            complite any tasks. Super Inteligence is AI that can do everything that humans can, but much better

                Each type of AI has its flaws.<br><br>
                &emsp;Super AI, AI with Super Inteligence, is a thread as it can replace humans.<br> <br> &emsp;Narrow
                Inteligence AI is unable to take decision if something happejnds that they don't know, this is because
                Narrow Inteligence is programmed to do one thing only. For example if someone create
                an AI to solve mazes it wont know what to do if a cat rounds the maze, it will just contenue. <br><br>
                &emsp; General Inteligence AI take time and it will nevr be as good at humans, due to its disability to
                think outside the box. AI can make desitions but they lack the ablility to think. Also a loops-hole
                might be found in our code. For example we might
                program an AI to destrooy anything that constributes to climate change, if the AI thinks that humans are
                constributing to climate change, then it will destroy all humans.

                AI is a useful tool and, like it or not, its here to stay and i belive that it must saty that way, a
                tool. Something that humans use that make there lifes easier but not replace humans
