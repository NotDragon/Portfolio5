                Climate change is the most recognisd problem, and, I belive, is imposible to avoid. If we continue
                worming up the planet at this speed, their will be major
                consequences. Also one other inportant thing today is cacao.

                <h3>How does climate change effect cacao?</h3>
            </u>
            <p>
                Cacao is very dificult to grow. It must be kept at a specific temprature and humidity for the whole
                year. Climate change, as you may know,
                effects both thing.

            <p>
                Soon, if nothing changes, cacao trees will not be able to grow. But it wont be only cacao trees. Many
                plants and animals are effected by climate change. If we continue in this rate their will be an
                abondence of resorces

                <h3>How can we stop this</h3>
            </u>
            <p>
                The only way to stop this from happening it to stop climate change. Some ways we can do this is:
            <ul>
                - Using electric cars<br>
                - Switching to renewable sources of energy<br>
                - Not use electric devices when passible<br>
                - Consume less meat<br>
            </ul>
